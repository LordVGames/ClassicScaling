# Classic Scaling

Brings back the old values for some parts of the game's scaling, making RoR Returns' difficulty closer to RoR1's. Each section of changes can be configured on/off, with every section being on by default. You can do change the config options in-game by looking for the mod under the `Config` tab at the top of the ImGui menu (the default key to open it is `Insert`).

The following things are changed:

## Elite stat buffs
- Elite HP multiplier: 2.8 > 2.6
- Elite HP multiplier (honor artifact): 2.2 > 2.1
- Elite damage multiplier: 1.9 > 1.7

## Enemy strength increase on stage change
- **Number added no longer increases exponentially per stage**
- Leaving stage 1/2: + 0.4
- Leaving stage 3: + 0.5
- Leaving stage 4/5: + 0.45
- Entering contact light: + 0.45
- - (not in addition to previous numbers)

## Stage credits:
- Base multiplier: 0.7 > 1
- Multiplayer multiplier: 0.3 > 0.5
- - (added on to the base multiplier for every player other than the host)

### Other notes
This mod does **not** change/remove anything else that was changed from RoR1 to RoR Returns. This includes:
- Any base stat increases for some enemies
- New attacks for some enemies
